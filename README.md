# Giphy

A dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice using the GIPHY API

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

A form is available that takes the value from a user input box and adds it to the list of buttons on the top for a user to click on
